[00:16.62] Her face is cracked from smiling
[00:18.30] All the fears that she's been hiding
[00:20.25] And it seems that pretty soon
[00:22.31] Everybody's gonna know
[00:33.31] 
[00:31.27] And her voice is sore from shouting
[00:33.01] Cheering winners who are losing
[00:35.06] And she worries if their days are few
[00:37.58] And soon they'll have to go
[00:51.08] 
[00:47.39] My, my, my, I'm so happy
[00:50.77] I'm gonna join the band
[00:54.60] We are gonna dance and sing in celebration
[00:58.73] We are in the promised land
[01:12.23] 
[01:02.01] She hears them talk of new ways
[01:04.81] To protect the home she lives in
[01:06.18] Then she wonders what it's all about
[01:08.50] When they break down the door
[01:23.00] 
[01:16.65] Her name is Brown or White or Black
[01:18.35] You know her very well
[01:20.05] You hear her cries of mercy
[01:22.55] As the winners toll the bell
[01:36.55] 
[01:31.68] My, my, my, I'm so happy
[01:35.32] I'm gonna join the band
[01:40.62] We are gonna dance and sing in celebration
[01:44.13] We are in the promised land
[01:57.63] 
[02:02.28] There is a train that leaves the station
[02:04.03] Heading for your destination
[02:06.00] But the price you pay to nowhere
[02:08.12] Has increased a dollar more
[02:11.23] Yes, it has
[02:16.73] 
[02:16.78] And if you walk you're gonna get there
[02:18.47] Though it takes a little longer
[02:20.45] And when you see it in the distance
[02:22.69] You will wring your hands and moan
