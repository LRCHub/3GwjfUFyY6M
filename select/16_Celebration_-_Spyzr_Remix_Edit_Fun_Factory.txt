Let's have a celebration by the sea
And get together in peace and harmony
A celebration come and have some fun
Singing oh oh ooh oh, oh oh oh ooh oh

Let's have a celebration by the sea
And get together in peace and harmony
A celebration come and have some fun
Singing oh oh ooh oh, oh oh oh ooh oh
Singing oh oh ooh oh, oh oh oh ooh oh

Bang, bang, bang
Here comes the jam
It's the fun factory
Coming with the next party jam

So what's up, what's on
Baby, come on tell me
Is it me? Is it you?
Tell me, tell me, please don't play me

Chillin' with the girlies
Ridin' with the fellows in my car
Di di di di dam di di da

So come on wave your hands in the air
So come on wave it like you just don't care
And if you're down with the fun factory groove
Somebody say, oh yeah

Let's have a celebration by the sea
And get together in peace and harmony
A celebration come and have some fun
Singing oh oh ooh oh, oh oh oh ooh oh

Let's have a celebration by the sea
And get together in peace and harmony
A celebration come and have some fun
Singing oh oh ooh oh, oh oh oh ooh oh
Singing oh oh ooh oh, oh oh oh ooh oh

Slam, slam, slam
Here comes the van
It's fun factory
And we do the best we can

We ring a ding ding
And we ring a ring dong
We hype up the place
With the bombastic song

We move to the left
We move to the right
And we wave
Our hands from side to side

You better step back
'Cause we don't stop, we want
So let's step together
And have some fun

There is a place
Where we have some fun
Yes, it's better all together
And we're dancing one on one

There is a place
Where we have some fun
Yes it's better all together
And we're dancing one on one

Let's have a celebration by the sea
And get together in peace and harmony
A celebration come and have some fun
Singing oh oh ooh oh, oh oh oh ooh oh

Let's have a celebration by the sea
And get together in peace and harmony
A celebration come and have some fun
Singing oh oh ooh oh, oh oh oh ooh oh
Singing oh oh ooh oh, oh oh oh ooh oh
Singing oh oh ooh oh, oh oh oh ooh oh
